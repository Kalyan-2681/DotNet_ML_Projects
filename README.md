Introduction & Motivation
I am a software developer, I started my career November 2004 and I love my job. The motivation to venture into Machine Learning and Data Science came from the tedious task of plucking weeds from my backyard lawn. I have an engineering degree in Electronics and Instrumentation and thought of automating the task by creating a mobile robot with a drill bit , but soon I figured out the challenges. 

The year 2020 confined us at home but opened opportunities to explore the web. Like many others I took to studying, wanted to explore how to create a robot that will uproot the weeds in my lawn and I came accross this video in Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP7GoNKcTS4

AS I started my career developing applications using c# , I wanted to explore what I can do with the technologies I am familiar with , Microsoft Dotnet. 

This github profile is after 4 months of studying what is Machine Learning ? I am starting with simple examples to bring myself upto speed.
