Todo Python app using flask and SQLLite DB

This is a basic CRUD application, will also help to learn concepts of rendering contents to 
frontend Html using jinja2. I followed this as a tutorial from freecodecamp, same code as the tutorial. 
My goal was to watch the video and finish the code myself. I plan to enhance this application further. 

1. Create a directory "todolist"
2. We will create a virtual environment inside this new directory we created in step 1
say we name our virrual environment directory as "work_env", so use dos command cd and 
when we are in "todolist" run the following command
c:\todolist>python -m venv work_env
3. Activate the virtual environment by running 
c:\todolist> work_env\Scripts\activate
(work_env) will show in terminal
4. requirements.txt lists all packages that the python code needs to run.
5. Run the following command to install all requirements within the virtual environment
Pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Continue writing the python code as now we have the environment setup completed.
